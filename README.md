"The Imp" - small, skinnable, video player written during my vacation break in 2002 for Windows XP. After 14 (!) years program still runs and works great on latest release of Windows (Windows10).
I've found sources of it in 2016 - after 14 years, and immediately decided that it's worth to upload them.
The Imp, and all dependants projects are written in Visual Studio 6.0.
Code is not "the most beautifull" code out there - especially readability and naming convention lacks a lot - but hey, I've written this even before I've started studying - and it's still working code, so if anyone finds them useful - it'll be great.
