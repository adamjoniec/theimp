# The Imp videoplayer
"The Imp" - small, skinnable, video player written during my vacation break in 2002 for Windows XP. 

I've found sources of it in 2016 - after 14 years, and immediately decided that it's worth to upload them. 

After 14 (!) years program still runs and works great on latest release of Windows (Windows10).

Code readability and naming convention lacks a lot - but hey, I've written this even before I've started studying (and long before "The Art of Readable Code" waas published)- and it's working code, so if anyone finds it useful - that's great.

Main program, and all dependant projects are written in Visual Studio 6.0
